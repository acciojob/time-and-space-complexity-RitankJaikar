	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It is a critical measure in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of processing time. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, which means they can handle larger inputs faster. The most common time complexities are constant time O(1), logarithmic time O(log n), linear time O(n), and quadratic time O(nÂ²), among others. The goal in algorithm design is often to find the most time-efficient solution to a problem.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm needs relative to the size of its input. Efficient algorithms also aim to minimize space usage. Space complexity is often measured in Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the input size. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity means the memory used grows linearly with the input size. It's important to balance both time and space complexities when designing algorithms for optimal performance.</p>
